{ : .prompt-tip } I don't know if this configuration is possible to make in Vmware Player (knowed by Vmware Free too). Might you can use the default network drivers and some custom NAT networks to make it, but probably it's more annoying than use the GUI.
{ : .prompt-tip }I did't notice any problems and you may don't need to manual configure the driver itself. So, after that.

{ : .prompt-tip }Also i've been used the whonix always in live mode, since the Vmware in normal boot have a huge problems about drivers and similars.

```
Whonix Vware + Custom nat

In Whonix Gateway:
sudo date -s "DD MM YY HH:MM:SS" && sudo hwclock -w
> "17 OCT 2023 01:00:00" (Sempre horÃ¡rio do UTC)

(Configure using the NAT)
sudo ifconfig {any driver but that 10.152.xx.xx) inet 192.168.xx.xx netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.xx.255
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.xx.xx
> Check start and end from IP range.


sudo nano /etc/systemcheck.d/30_default.conf
"""
NO_EXIT_ON_UNSUPPORTED_VIRTUALIZER="1"

NO_EXIT_ON_IP_FORWARDING_DETECTION="1"
"""

systemcheck

sudo tor@default restart

in your VM:
(If you don't have any IP addr attributed)
sudo dhclient

(for the same driver in whonix gateway 10.152.xx.xx)

sudo ifconfig {interface} inet 10.152.152.11 netmask 255.255.192.00 broadcast 10.152.191.255
sudo ip route add default via 10.152.152.xx (THAT IP SHOWS IN Whonix)
```
